My interests are in technology, people, data, society, art. I'm keen on community building in technology, public communication of data.

### Now
I'm at [Gramener](https://gramener.com/) currently since mid-late-2016. I work out of Hyderabad.

### Know
- I co-organize data storytelling events regularly ([meetup](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-EkjzkhLt/)). Explore [#datastoryday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/datastoryday?src=hashtag_click) or [#comicsworkshop](https://twitter.com/hashtag/comicsworkshop?src=hashtag_click) on Twitter.
- I volunteer my time with [BehanBox](https://www.behanbox.com/) whenever time permits.

I'm good at software development, data visualization, data analysis, prototyping, technical writing, mentoring. Reach out to me if you need assistance or to collaborate. Email - `talk2kish at google's email`.
