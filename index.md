My interests are in technology, people, data, society, art. I'm keen on community building in technology, public communication of data.

## Now
I'm at [Gramener](https://gramener.com/) currently since mid-late-2016. I work out of Hyderabad.

## Know
I co-organize data storytelling events regularly ([meetup](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-EkjzkhLt/)). Explore [#datastoryday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/datastoryday?src=hashtag_click) or [#comicsworkshop](https://twitter.com/hashtag/comicsworkshop?src=hashtag_click) on Twitter.

## Past
I used to be an academic but haven't been one since mid-2016. You could look at my earlier [research](https://bkamapantula.github.io/research/) if interested.
