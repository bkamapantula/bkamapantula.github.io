# Data storytelling with maps

[Story Labs](https://gramener.com/storylabs/) at Gramener is working on a [Data Storytelling Framework](https://gramener.com/storylabs-publications/defining-data-storytelling). One of the formats is narration through [Map Stories](https://gramener.com/storylabs-publications/map-stories).

Since maps fascinate me, I'm interested to tryout few example datasets and try to narrate few important aspects from them. Consider the obesity rate (%) in Virginia state counties across the years 2019 and 2020.

*Virginia Obesity rate 2019. Each county is colored using its Obesity Rate in 2019.*

*Virginia Obesity rate 2020. Each county is colored using its Obesity Rate in 2020.*

## Juxtaposing

[Knightlab](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/)'s [Juxtapose](https://juxtapose.knightlab.com/) allows us to create juxtapositions easily and lets users swipe to notice the difference. This is an intuitive format that works well at the most granular level. Below is a representation of the same images from above.

*Swipe the slider to right or left to view 2019 or 2020 map*.
