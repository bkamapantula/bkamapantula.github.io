## Few more

Eenadu newspaper covered these apart from few others (Just Books, Vivekananda Institute, British Library) in the 9th Feb Hyderabad district edition.

Eenadu reported that there are some communities that access libraries more than the rest. While students preparing for IELTS frequent British Library, students preparing for competitive exams frequent City *Central Library*, *Telangana State Central Library* (largest, oldest among all). *Krishna Devaraya Bhasha Nilayam*, *Telangana State Archives*, *Telugu University Library* receive more research scholars.

## To be updated

With the green line of Hyderabad Metro opening recently it's more easier to access some of these than earlier. I'll be visiting these in the coming weeks and update this entry.
