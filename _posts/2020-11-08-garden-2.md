In a [previous post](https://bkamapantula.github.io/2020/10/05/garden.html) I wrote about revamping our garden. We have since completed coloring the stands, the support structures and placed plants on the stands.

## Variety

There are 110 pots (different sizes) in total. The stands can still support 25 pots and there's space for another 15 pots next to the stands on the roof.

We kept a stand aside to sit and lazy around.

Currently here's the variety of plants in the garden:

- edible herbs: basil, gangavayala kura, gongura, spinach, vine spinach (bachchali)
- flowers: chrysanthemums (chamanti), firecrackers (kanakambram), hibiscus (mandaram), mallelu, maruvam (no flowers but used along with kanakambram), nooru varahalu, roses, tulasi.
- vegetables: bottle gourd (sorakaya), brinjal (vankaya), french cut beans, goru chikkudukaya, okra (bendakaya), ridge gourd (beerakaya).
- fruits: guava (jamakaya), mango
- others: amla (usirikaya)

We have another small set of plants towards the road on ground: karivepaku, pomegranate, seetaphal

## Cost
### Stands
All in all, we made 18 stands of different lengths.

- 6 stands - 4 feet 9 inches
- 6 stands - 7 feet
- 3 stands - 9 feet
- 3 stands - 6 feet 9 inches

These stands costed INR ~37,000 (~$500).

Last week few relatives visited the garden and suggested to have caps/plates underneath the pots so outflowing water wouldn't damage the stands in the long run. Since we had construction material (parking tiles, wall tiles and door frame pieces) available from earlier we reused them.

### Structures
The canopy structures along with the water piping along three columns costed us INR ~35000.
