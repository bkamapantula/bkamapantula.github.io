# Data art round 1

After resolving to work on [gifts](https://bkamapantula.github.io/2020/01/15/gifts.html) last week, I spent time the past week in ideating on data-based gifts.

I discovered [Vistaprint](https://www.vistaprint.in/) recently. It looked like a good service to order custom coffee mugs, posters, thank you cards etc.

## Note card

I had a bunch of data points to pick from and went with the statistics of life expectancy in specific countries including India. I realized we tend to ignore the big picture and hustle about the small stuff at work and at home.
This statistic is a reminder of how far the world (specific countries in this case) has progressed in improving people's lives.

### Card back

I mapped these to note cards in Vistaprint. While the output looks fine on screen I'm eager to see how it translates to print in terms of text sharpness and overall card quality.

## City roads

[City roads](https://anvaka.github.io/city-roads/) is a beautiful project that highlights openstreemap road data for a given city. I thought it's a perfect way to make a personalized gift out of it.

Below is a snapshot of Hyderabad city roads. I wrapped it on a coffee mug.

I'll be testing out few other formats in the upcoming weeks to discover the best formats.
