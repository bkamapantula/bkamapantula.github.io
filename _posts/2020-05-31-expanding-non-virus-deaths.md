# On non-virus deaths

Last few weeks I've been tracking [Google Mobility data](https://bkamapantula.github.io/2020/05/16/google-mobility.html) and [non-virus deaths](https://bkamapantula.github.io/2020/05/25/non-virus-deaths.html).

Google mobility data, as of the latest report (27 May), suggests the continuity of post-lockdown activity levels although few states seem to show some change.

Non-virus deaths have seen a spike in recent weeks. Using [datameet's data](https://github.com/datameet/covid19/), I'm publishing the names of those who died and where they died here: [Non Virus Deaths](https://bkamapantula.github.io/nonvirusdeaths/). Also maintained at [BehanBox](http://covid19indiaresponse.behanbox.com/).

In the next week, I'll continue to extract from/to locations of those who walked but couldn't make it all the way during the lockdowns.

For up-to-date data on non-virus deaths follow the work of [Kanika](https://twitter.com/_kanikas_) on Twitter.
