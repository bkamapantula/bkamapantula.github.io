# About

### Know
1. I'm with *Gramener* currently (since Aug 2016) with primary focus on building developer tools. At Gramener, in the past, I focused on building data-driven visual solutions, architecting technical solutions and data communication among other things.
2. I co-organize data storytelling events regularly ([meetup](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-EkjzkhLt/)). Explore [#datastoryday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/datastoryday?src=hashtag_click) or [#comicsworkshop](https://twitter.com/hashtag/comicsworkshop?src=hashtag_click) on Twitter.
3. I volunteer my time (not too actively) with [BehanBox](https://www.behanbox.com/) on creating data stories, data projects. Follow [BehanBox](https://twitter.com/behanbox) for updates.
4. I'm an [OSM contributor](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Thoughtisdead). Largely, I'm interested in neighborhood mapping and making OSM accessible in Telugu. I use OSM's in-browser iD editor and [StreetComplete](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/) to contribute. I track the progress of our colony mapping at a [community site](https://talk.southendpark.org/t/mapping-our-colony/11) I maintain.

### Devices

1. My personal machine is a 13 inch Dell XPS that runs Ubuntu. It's lightweight and the smallest form factor laptop I've used so far. A [Gizga bag](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B01AY8OS46/) wraps it nicely.
2. I use a Pixel 3a. I love it, it's lightweight and has enough power and access control for apps.
3. I use a Amazon Kindle Fire to read ebooks. Most of my reading is on it.
4. A Raspberry Pi 4 helps us keep advertisements in check using [pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/). Very soon I'll get hold of a Raspberry Pi 400 for more experiments.

My primary browser is Mozilla Firefox and secondary one is Google Chrome. My preferred OS is Ubuntu.

### Reach me
I'm good at software development, data visualization, data analysis, prototyping, technical writing, technology consulting, mentoring. Reach out to me if you need assistance or to collaborate. Email - `talk2kish at google's email`.

If you'd like to know about me briefly, read: [Manager's Alphabet](https://github.com/bkamapantula/Managers-Alphabet/) (it's elaborate) that I compiled, [data science work](https://bkamapantula.github.io/2017/10/24/what-people-do-data-science.html), [2019 review](https://bkamapantula.github.io/2020/01/03/2019.html).

Also view: [Visualizations](https://bkamapantula.github.io/viz/). [News](https://bkamapantula.github.io/news.html).

### Past
- After Ph.D., I did a short postdoc from February to June 2016 at UW, Madison.
- I'm a 2015 Computer Science Ph.D. from [VCU](https://www.vcu.edu/). My work explored the structural robustness in biological and complex networks with applications to wireless sensor networks. Specifically, the objective of the research was to identify features responsible for biological robustness from a structural perspective.
- My interests used to be in systems biology apart from data science, visualization, and network science. [Research portfolio](https://bkamapantula.github.io/research/index.html) displays several of my past research projects and publication details between 2009-2016. [Visualization portfolio](https://bkamapantula.github.io/viz/index.html) mentions several interactive and static visuals developed by him since 2012.
