3. Bhanu is a 2015 Computer Science Ph.D. from [VCU](https://www.vcu.edu/). His work explored the structural robustness in biological and complex networks with applications to wireless sensor networks. Specifically, the objective of the research was to identify features responsible for biological robustness from a structural perspective.

His interests are in systems biology apart from data science, visualization, and network science. [Research portfolio](https://bkamapantula.github.io/research/index.html) displays several of his research projects and publication details between 2009-2016. [Visualization portfolio](https://bkamapantula.github.io/viz/index.html) mentions several interactive and static visuals developed by him since 2012.
