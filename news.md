#### July - Solr, Tableau

I wrote about the challenges in [connecting Tableau to Apache Solr](https://bkamapantula.github.io/2020/07/20/solr-tableau.html) as a live connection and subsequently making an extract connection via [sqlalchemy-solr](https://bkamapantula.github.io/2020/07/29/sqlalchemy-solr.html).

#### 24th January - Women protests map

I created a map highlighting women-led protests against NRC/NPR/CAA in India. Featured in [Behan Box article](https://www.behanbox.com/women-led-protest-map-against-citizenship-laws-in-india/). I tried Datawrapper map this time which turned out to be easy to use. Data can have multiple entries for a single city/state combination. Using addresses to map in Datawrapper will only retain the latest entry for a city/state that has multiple entries. Using Latitude/Longitude is a better option to address it.
